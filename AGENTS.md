# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v1 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards


<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Resolve this standards root once and use it as the global authority for the current task:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`

Read only the relevant README task-matrix row or navigation heading, then load the selected authority sections.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

This is a multi-surface SDKWork application repository. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` before changing application behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release metadata, or app-owned capabilities.

### Application Surfaces

| Surface | Root | Architecture Spec |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| PC (Desktop/Web) | `apps/sdkwork-birdcoder-pc/` | `APP_PC_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` |
| H5 (Mobile Web/Capacitor) | `apps/sdkwork-birdcoder-h5/` | `APP_H5_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` |
| Flutter Mobile | `apps/sdkwork-birdcoder-flutter-mobile/` | `FLUTTER_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` |

### Shared Packages

- `packages/sdkwork-birdcoder-*` — Cross-surface shared contracts owned by this repository when a BirdCoder-owned capability requires them; no shared contract package is currently declared.
- Each app root has its own surface-specific packages in `packages/`
- Shared SDKWork platform packages (`sdkwork-iam`, `sdkwork-appbase`, `sdkwork-ui`, `sdkwork-core`, `sdkwork-utils`, etc.) are external workspace dependencies resolved through `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, not owned by this repository

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: local agent entrypoint and relative SDKWORK spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code compatibility shim that points to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `GEMINI.md`: Gemini CLI compatibility shim that points to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `CODEX.md`: Codex compatibility shim that points to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: application identity and owned capability metadata.
- `.sdkwork/`: reserved local dictionary folder; create only for local skills, plugins, manifests, or AI workspace metadata.
- `specs/`: local application/component contracts and narrowing rules.
- `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: language/build manifests.
- `Cargo.toml`: Rust workspace configuration.
- `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`: TypeScript configuration.
- `etc/`: deployable-root source configuration, environment/profile index, topology profiles, gateway templates, and safe runtime examples governed by `SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md`.
- Local directories to inspect first when relevant: `apis/`, `apps/`, `etc/`, `crates/`, `deployments/`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `external/`, `jobs/`, `plugins/`, `scripts/`, `specs/`, `tests/`, `tools/`.

## Spec Resolution Order


<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task: resolve the selected root and task category before reading broad source context.

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` routing material and classify the owned surface.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json`, module `specs/`, repository/application `specs/`, and `.sdkwork/` only when the task reaches the contract each item governs.
3. Locate only the relevant task-matrix row or navigation heading in `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`; do not load the full catalog.
4. Read only the task-specific global spec sections selected by that route, then inspect implementation files.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` when present.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` when present.
4. Read local `.sdkwork/README.md`, `.sdkwork/skills/`, and `.sdkwork/plugins/` when relevant.
5. Read `../sdkwork-specs/README.md` and the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files only after the relevant dictionary entries are clear.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- Rust code: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_RPC_SPEC.md` when RPC is touched.
- Java/Spring code: `../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md` when HTTP backend behavior is touched.
- TypeScript/Node code: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`.
- Frontend/UI code: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, and exactly one detailed UI architecture spec.
- API, SDK, database, runtime, security, and deployment changes must follow the task matrix in `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load Rust, Java, TypeScript, and frontend specs for unrelated tasks.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.
- Verification: `node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace .`

## Code Style Rules

Read `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes.

Load language specs only when touched: Rust uses `RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, Java/Spring uses `JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md`, TypeScript/Node uses `TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`, and frontend/UI uses `FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`.

For TypeScript or frontend code, prefer strict types, explicit package exports, colocated tests, and existing package/module boundaries.

Build scripts, dev runners, and `pnpm clean` must follow `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7 (Build Source Integrity And Self-Healing). Git-tracked build-critical source files must be verified before builds and self-healed from git when missing; `clean` must not delete them.

## Build, Test, and Verification


<!-- SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->
Choose only the narrowest verification selected by the changed surface. This is not a default full-suite command list.
Run workspace-wide checks only when the change crosses that boundary.
`bootstrap-*`, `align-*`, `sync-*`, `--write`, and other mutating repair commands are not verification defaults; use them only for an explicitly scoped repair, migration, bootstrap, or alignment task and inspect the resulting diff.
<!-- /SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->

Run commands from this directory unless a command explicitly targets another path.

- `pnpm install`: install dependencies for this workspace or package.
- `pnpm run dev`: start the local development server or app shell.
- `pnpm run build`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run lint`: run lint and static checks.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: run TypeScript type checks.
- `pnpm run check:arch`: run repository verification or architecture checks.
- `pnpm run check:package-governance`: run repository verification or architecture checks.
- `pnpm run preview`: serve built artifacts locally.
- `pnpm run build:cloud`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run build:demo`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run build:dev`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run build:local`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run build:private`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run build:prod`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run build:test`: build production artifacts or package outputs.
- `pnpm run check:api-transport-standard`: run repository verification or architecture checks.
- `pnpm run check:auth-session-standard`: run repository verification or architecture checks.
- `pnpm run check:ci-flow`: run repository verification or architecture checks.

Run the narrowest relevant check first, then broader verification when API contracts, SDK generation, persistence, security, or cross-package boundaries change.

## Agent Execution Rules


<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task; treat indexes and cross-references as discovery, not as a startup bundle.
Keep `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` and the task-selected standards authoritative; expand context only when evidence exposes a new contract boundary.
Language-specific specs are on-demand: only the touched language loads `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`, or `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`.
Package command standardization loads `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md` only when the current task changes package commands or scripts; GitHub packaging work loads `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md` only when it reaches that workflow boundary.
Do not infer a recursive workspace scan or a broad validation suite from the presence of a path alone.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Use the convention dictionary instead of broad context loading. Do not hand-edit generated SDK output unless the task is explicitly about generated artifacts and the source contract is verified. Do not replace generated SDK integration with raw HTTP. Keep changes scoped to the owning module, package, crate, or app root. Record the exact verification commands and important outputs before reporting completion.

## Task-Specific Standards

API work loads `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` and its validators. List/search work loads `../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and `check-pagination.mjs`. Source configuration work loads `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md` and `check-source-config-standard.mjs`. Link these authorities instead of copying their normative bodies into `AGENTS.md`.

## Human Review Rules

Request human review before breaking SDKWORK standards, changing public naming, altering security/auth behavior, changing database migrations or production deployment config, deleting data/files, or changing generated SDK ownership. Surface unresolved spec paths, app identity conflicts, component ownership conflicts, and API authority ambiguity instead of guessing.

## Additional Build Commands

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: install the workspace exactly as CI expects.
- `pnpm dev:test-runner`: start the test-mode web host.
- `pnpm build:server`: build the Rust server host.
- `pnpm dev:desktop` / `pnpm build:desktop`: run the desktop host.
- `pnpm check:desktop` / `pnpm check:server` / `pnpm check:multi-mode`: verify target-specific delivery layers.
- `pnpm docs:build`: build the VitePress documentation site.

## Testing

Contract tests are script-based and live in `scripts/*.test.mjs` and `scripts/release/*.test.mjs`. Add focused tests beside the release or architecture script you change. Before submitting work, run at least `pnpm lint`; for release or deployment changes also run `pnpm check:release-flow` and the relevant `pnpm release:smoke:*` command.

## Commit Guidelines

Use short imperative commits with scope, for example `fix release asset manifest layout` or `chore align ci flow`. Pull requests should summarize the changed architecture area, list touched packages or deployment layers, include the exact verification commands run, and attach screenshots only for UI-visible shell changes.

<!-- SDKWORK-NAMING-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Naming And Dependency Declaration

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1 and section 3.2.

Two identifier planes exist in every Rust crate and they MUST NOT be mixed: the package plane
(Cargo, filesystem, lock file) uses kebab-case, and the crate plane (lib target, modules, source
imports) uses snake_case.

- `[package].name`, the crate directory, `[features]` keys, and `[[bin]].name` use kebab-case.
- `[lib].name`, module files, module directories, and Rust imports use snake_case.
- A crate whose `[package].name` contains a hyphen SHOULD declare `[lib].name` explicitly
  (default: package name with every `-` replaced by `_`). A shorter lib name is allowed only
  when declared explicitly and used consistently by every consumer.
- Cargo dependency keys, `[workspace.dependencies]` keys, and `Cargo.lock` entries use the
  dependency package name. Use `package = "..."` when an alias is required.
- Every external crate referenced by `src/` MUST be declared in that crate's `[dependencies]`.
  Test-only crates belong in `[dev-dependencies]`; `build.rs` crates belong in
  `[build-dependencies]`.
- Never delete a dependency line, and never demote one from `[dependencies]` to
  `[dev-dependencies]`, while `src/` still imports it. Verify manifest cleanups with the
  command below before committing them.
- Regenerate and commit `Cargo.lock` in the same change as any dependency table edit.

Verification:

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-crate-naming-standard.mjs --root .
```
<!-- /SDKWORK-NAMING-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-RUST-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline); package/crate
naming and dependency declaration are normative in `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1
and 3.2.

- Crates are responsibility-shaped: service, repository-sqlx, routes, service-host, native-host,
  worker, assembly, gateway. No generic `core`/`common`/`backend`/`runtime` suffixes.
- Errors are typed enums (`thiserror`) implementing `std::error::Error` with a `source` chain.
  `anyhow` only at binary/CLI/test boundaries, never in lib `[dependencies]`.
- No `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment; crates default to `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.
  No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in library code reachable from public API.
- No lock guard held across `.await`; every external await has a timeout; spawned tasks are
  awaited/detached with a documented owner; retries are bounded, jittered, and idempotent.
- Public API is minimal, documented, `#[must_use]` where applicable, and semver-clean. Leaking
  framework types (`sqlx::Row`, axum extractors) through public signatures is forbidden.
- Workspace root declares `[workspace.package]` (edition, rust-version) and `[workspace.lints]`
  (RUST_CODE_SPEC.md section 13 baseline); every member inherits both with
  `edition.workspace = true` and `[lints] workspace = true`.

Verification:

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-crate-naming-standard.mjs --root .
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-manifest-standard.mjs --root .
# when service/repository/route/gateway dependencies change:
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-backend-composition.mjs --root .
```
<!-- /SDKWORK-RUST-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-TYPESCRIPT-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## TypeScript Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline).

- `tsconfig` runs `strict: true` and the strict family; public APIs are typed and `any`-free.
  `import type` is required for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- Errors are typed at package/service boundaries; no empty catches, no swallowed promise
  rejections, no bare `throw new Error('...')` for business failures.
- Async: every promise is settled; external awaits have timeouts; `AbortSignal` accepted for
  cancellable work; bounded concurrency; no unbounded `Promise.all`.
- Public API is minimal, JSDoc-documented, `@deprecated` where applicable, and semver-clean.
- Discriminated unions model closed variant sets; no `as`/`@ts-ignore` bypasses without a guard.
- Node/build runners verify build-critical sources and self-heal from git (CODE_STYLE_SPEC §7);
  `pnpm clean` never deletes git-tracked build-critical files.

Verification:

```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm lint
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-application-layering.mjs --root .
```
<!-- /SDKWORK-TYPESCRIPT-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-DART-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Dart Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/DART_CODE_SPEC.md` (v1); Flutter root/UI rules follow
`../sdkwork-specs/FLUTTER_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/APP_FLUTTER_UI_SPEC.md`.

- Sound null safety; `lints`/`flutter_lints` baseline; `dart analyze` and `dart format` clean.
- `lib/<package>.dart` barrel exports only public API; no `src/` imports across packages.
- Errors are typed exceptions or results; no bare `Exception('...')`, swallowed catches, or
  unhandled futures (`unawaited` only with a documented reason).
- `build()` is pure (no IO/network/timers); `const` constructors where possible; stable list
  keys; controllers/subscriptions disposed.
- Null safety discipline: no `!` assertions or `as` casts in public API paths; sealed classes
  for closed variant sets.
- External awaits have timeouts; blocking work moves to `compute`/isolates; no UI-thread blocking.

Verification:

```bash
dart analyze && dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed
flutter test   # or: dart test for pure Dart packages
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-application-layering.mjs --root .
```
<!-- /SDKWORK-DART-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-FRONTEND-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Frontend Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2); language rules follow
`../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (React/TS) or `../sdkwork-specs/DART_CODE_SPEC.md` (Flutter).

- UI -> service -> injected SDK flow is preserved; components never construct SDK clients or
  assemble raw HTTP/auth headers.
- React: hooks rules clean (`react-hooks`), `useEffect` with full deps and cleanup, stable
  list keys, error boundaries at route/page level, derived state during render (not in effects).
- State: server state behind services/query layer; client state local or minimal typed store;
  no duplication of server state in client stores.
- Accessibility: accessible names, keyboard behavior, visible focus, color is never the only
  signal; error states announced.
- i18n for all user-facing copy in reusable/user-facing packages (I18N_SPEC §6.1).
- PC/H5 `outDir` uses `dist/{standalone,cloud}/{dev,test,staging,prod}`.

Verification:

```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm lint
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-application-layering.mjs --root .
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-browser-dist-layout.mjs --root .   # PC/H5 apps

<!-- /SDKWORK-FRONTEND-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-PNPM-WORKSPACE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## pnpm Workspace Dependency And Package Import

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_WORKSPACE_DEPENDENCY_SPEC.md` (companion to
`../sdkwork-specs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).

Sibling SDKWork repositories are consumed through a dual-track model that MUST stay consistent:

- **Local development** (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`): pnpm workspace protocol. Each sibling
  package is declared ONCE in this repository root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` as a
  `../sdkwork-*` relative path, and consumed with `workspace:*` in `package.json`. Never use
  `file:`/`link:`/git-URL specifiers for SDKWork sibling packages in any environment.
- **CI / release packaging**: git-repository dependency checkout. Every sibling referenced by the
  local workspace MUST have a matching `dependencies[]` entry in `sdkwork.workflow.json` so CI
  clones the sibling into the same `../sdkwork-*` relative layout (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`).
  `package.json` is never rewritten for CI.

Import rules for sibling SDKWork packages:

- Import by package name only: `import { X } from "@sdkwork/package-name"`. The specifier MUST
  equal the target package's `package.json` `name` exactly - no shortening, renaming, or alias.
- Forbidden: relative imports that cross a package boundary into another SDKWork repository or
  another workspace package's `src/` (for example `import ... from "../../sdkwork-appbase/.../src/..."`).
- Consume only the public `exports` surface of a package; never deep-import sibling `src/` internals.
- Every non-relative import in a workspace member MUST resolve to that member's own
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (import closure).
- Vite aliases MUST NOT rename or redirect `@sdkwork/*` packages, MUST NOT be added to make a
  resolution error pass, and are allowed only for documented bootstrap/SDK-generation entrypoints.
- Fix a resolution failure by correcting the workspace declaration or the package `exports`,
  not by adding an alias.

<!-- SDKWORK-SDK-GENERATION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Generated SDK Output Is Generator-Owned

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`.

Everything generated under `sdks/` — `generated/server-openapi/` trees, generated language
workspaces, `dist/` build output, generated `sdkwork-sdk.json`, generated
`.sdkwork/sdkwork-generator-*` reports, and standardizer-synced OpenAPI snapshots — is produced by
the canonical SDK generator `../sdkwork-sdk-generator/bin/sdkgen.js` (`@sdkwork/sdk-generator`).

- Do not hand-edit generated SDK files, including type definitions, dist bundles, and generated
  package metadata. Manual edits are overwritten by the next generation run and break
  reproducibility and contract audits.
- When generated or compiled SDK output does not meet a contract or standard, fix the upstream
  source — authored API contract, route manifest, OpenAPI authority, derived `*.sdkgen.*` input,
  generator profile, or `custom/` runtime build scripts — then regenerate through the standard
  generation command. Do not patch generated output in place.
- Remove stale generated files by re-running the family generation command, which owns cleanup of
  disappeared routes and models; do not hand-prune generated trees.
- The only approved handwritten surfaces are `custom/` roots inside generated workspaces and
  authored `composed/` facades outside `generated/server-openapi`.
